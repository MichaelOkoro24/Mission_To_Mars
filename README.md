# Mission_to_Mars
## Overview
In this module we helped a Junior Data scientist Robin create a webpage, using  CSS, and HTML to gather all the information she searches for into the webpage. We helped her build a web application that would scrape new data everytime she tells it to and the data will be stored in a MongoDB database.
